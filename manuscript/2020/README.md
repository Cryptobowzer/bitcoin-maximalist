Like every single Ponzi scheme ever, Bitcoin sucked in those who only understand number go up.
That's why it's impossible to have a rational conversation with a Bitcoiner as he'll end it after twelve seconds, out of arguments, with "well it's up 7,900% since 2010 so you're wrong".

## Crypto ("Stable") Dollar Coins - Tether ($USDT)


Tether ($USDT) is a scam, they haven't
done a proper audit in years
and the New York Attorney General
has revealed that they're not fully backed.

Getting interest on bank deposits is totally normal.

Banks lending out your deposit to earn interest so that they can pay you interest is OK.

The person getting the loan will deposit it back with the bank, sure.

But fractional banking is a scam!
Banks are printing money!

Since Tether started the exponential printing of its coin 8 months ago, USDT has lost 80% of its value.
The trick was to make people believe that 1 USDT = 1 USD. Which, because nobody can sell their USDTs, wasn't that hard.

You've got to admire the regularity of these Tether prints.
Who's holding them? Why would anyone buy Tethers in lieu of holding fiat? Why would people rush into a stablecoin in the midst of a supposed raging bull market for crypto? Why nobody in the community is talking about it?

There are zero advantages of giving away legit cash in exchange of USDTs. Tether is unsupervised, unregulated, there is no legal recourse in case anything goes wrong, even their Term of Service denies any and all liability. They’ve even deleted the bit where they used to pretend it's backed.

Bagholders have been brainwashed to believe that bitcoins can only rise in value because its supply is programmed to decline. They've heard of the law of "supply & demand", but never managed to explain the "demand" part, so they just assume it's a given.

This is why Bitcoiners are physically unable to question Tether printing billions of $USDT to buy their beloved coin. To them, it's just the materialisation of this supernatural force they've never managed to explain, yet that must exist & crave their invaluable crypto beans.

FOMO doesn't happen when you think something will go up. FOMO kicks when your reptilian brain takes over, and you no longer believe that thing can go down.
Few people remember $BTC went from 23 to 2.
But everyone knows how it went from 20_000 to 4_000.

## The New New "Antifragile" Digital Gold


> Austrian Maximalist writes:

> "... Bitcoin is a kind of digital gold, likely to retain its value
>  during time of turmoil ..."

Bitcoin was tested only once for its "antifragile" feature eigth months ago
[in March 2020 start of the COVID pandemic / crisis], and disintegrated like a house of cards, only surviving thanks to massive printing of fake tetherized dollars and collusion among crypto exchanges.
You've got to be either clueless or corrupt to say this.

It only took the printing of $15 billion worth of centralised stablecoins to get corporations to buy $600 million worth of Bitcoin.

 Paypal's move was a death sentence for crypto. It's much easier for people to simply "buy Bitcoin" on Paypal, instead of sending their USD to exchanges & Tether (USDT).
That's why they rushed their epic pump now, before Paypal gains traction, to get as much fear of missing out (FOMO) cash as they still can.

And for sure there it is:

So now it appears exchanges need Tethers to transfer value between them, and USDTs are good because the crypto ecosystem is growing & needs liquidity.
If only there was a censorship resistant way to transfer value...
Where is the “containers not parcels” clown when you need him!

Look I understand that in order to run a business you need something that’s practical and useable and you choose Tethers for that purpose because Bitcoin sucks in every way imaginable. It’s just too funny to watch you bend in four pretending otherwise to keep the muppets hooked.

We tend to forget that the 2017 Bitcoin pump was relatively organic, supported by Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). People needed Bitcoins to buy Dentcoin & al., and these Bitcoins were subsequently frozen, reducing supply. It wasn't a zero-sum game in the short run.
The situation is different today.
- [Nov 16](https://twitter.com/Tr0llyTr0llFace/status/1328284697571586048)



Tether has implemented the fiat model, where new USDTs are issued against promises to pay them back.
"I'll give you 50M USDTs if pay me 50M USDs in one year".
This has multiple advantages:
1. No need to transfer cash, of wonder when Feds will freeze your bank account.
2. Tethers are effectively backed by loans (or bonds), which can have a credible valuation based on the financial health of the entity that receives the new Tethers (will Binance be able to pay you 50M USDs in one year? Probably!).
3. When receiving entities are exchanges, who also control the price of USDT, you get a nice cointegrated ecosystem where everyone owes someone a favour - exchanges maintain the peg, while Tether doesn't push them too hard to repay their "loans". This means no funny games.


This also has two major disadvantages:
1. There is no real money in the money jar. It all works only as long as people don't cash out for fiat.
2. Everyone is tied together in the Tether boat. Because exchanges have all their assets in USDT, when Tether fails, everyone goes bust.

Remember how the price of Bitcoin was systematically higher on Bitfinex relatively to other exchanges, back in 2017? That's because the use of USDTs wasn't so widespread yet. This has changed now, with the crash of March 2020 being a very important catalyst.


I've always wondered, what's the point of having USDTs on the blockchain, where everyone can see the printing. If they want to pump prices, isn't it better to do it in the dark, MtGox - style?
Well, exchanges wouldn't have accepted to use USDT without proper transparency.

If I ran an online exchange, I wouldn't accept funny coins backed by promises, if I weren't absolutely sure everyone abides by the rules. If were to agree to maintain the peg on my exchange, I would want to see everything.
Ironically, that's where blockchain is useful, for once.

The Bagholder Theorem

It doesn't matter how much you know about Bitcoin and computers and finance and economics.
If you don't believe that Bitcoin will go up forever into infinity, you don't understand Bitcoin.

Bitcoin has been programmed to go up, regardless of external events and market forces. You’ve got to read between the lines of code to see it, but it’s inevitable.
Whoever tries to prove the contrary using facts, is trying to make you sell your Bitcoins to buy them on the cheap.

Ok, I've read it.

1. "Having multiple currencies is inefficient" - completely ignorant assumption.
Different currencies help to balance economic cycles that vary from
 country to country. You need different monetary policies for different economies, or you'll blow up bubbles in one place while dooming other places to deflationary hell.

2. "Bitcoin will become that single currency” - why? It can't scale, it's terribly inefficient and costly.
and it would have to, if ever we all transition to a new currency, out-compete all other possible forms of money, which would be pushed by governments. Look how the Euro was adopted. You think a private initiative where people of Europe would have accepted that they need
to buy their new Euros from some dude, thus giving it value, while the dude would retain most of the Euros, and become rentier for life, while they would have to slave to get some more Euros from him, to perpetuity? You think people are really that stupid.
And then, why would that dude accept to sell his Euros for soon to be worthless francs and marks and liras? You think the dude is really that stupid.
Without governments, the transition would have been impossible. Governments simply issued a new currency and said "this is it".
